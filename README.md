# Sailing app for connectIQ Garmin

Sailing is a watch app for tracking sailing activities displaying speed in knots and heading direction.

This is written in MonkeyC and currently targets the  VivoActive 3 (but I'd love to see people work on ports to other watches).

# Features
- GPS tracking
- current speed (in knots)
- max speed (in knots)
- current direction (heading in degrees)
- distance (in nm )
- time
- add wind info

- twd, max speed will be in CIQ data

# How to use it

# TODO

- add tacking helpers ?
- add VMG calculation
- add waypoint handling ?
